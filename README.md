# Core Philosophies

This project and our church places an emphasis on simplicity, and brevity to combat information overload. Please keep all info brief, including breaks and folds.

This project is maintained by self identifying non denominational Christians to combat biases.

We aim to operate from The Spirit of Wisdom, which is God. Below is an example of a simple entry to explain what that means.

# God is Wisdom and Lives in us
## Isaiah 11:1-2 NIV
1 A shoot will come up from the stump of Jesse;  
    from his roots a Branch will bear fruit.  
2 The Spirit of the Lord will rest on him—  
    the Spirit of wisdom and of understanding,  
    the Spirit of counsel and of might,  
    the Spirit of the knowledge and fear of the Lord—

Wisdom is part of The Spirit of The Lord
## Zechariah 4:2-4 NIV
2 He asked me, “What do you see?”
	I answered, “I see a solid gold lampstand with a bowl at the top and seven lamps on it,  with seven channels to the lamps. 
3 Also there are two olive trees by it, one on the right of the bowl and the other on its left.”
4 I asked the angel who talked with me, “What are these, my lord?”
5 He answered, “Do you not know what these are?”
	“No, my lord,” I replied.
6 So he said to me, “This is the word of the Lord to Zerubbabel: ‘Not by might nor by power, but by my Spirit,’ says the Lord Almighty.

The 7 spirits seen in Zechariah's vision are seen as a Menorah
God says "but by my Spirit" these are the same 7 spirits as in Isaiah 11:2 that rest on Jesus in Matthew 3:16

## Matthew 3:16 NIV
1 As soon as Jesus was baptized, he went up out of the water. At that moment heaven was opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting on him.

## John 14:26 NIV
26 But the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you.

It isn't a stretch to say that the spirit of Counsel, Knowledge, and Wisdom which are part of the 7 spirits of the Lord, that descended on Jesus is the one teaching us and reminding us In John 14:26

So Wisdom is (one part of) The Spirit of God, The Spirit of God is The Holy Spirit, and The Holy Spirit lives in us 1 Corinthians 6:19

## 1 Corinthians 6:19
19 Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own;

Therefor every Christian has access to Wisdom, Counsel and Knowledge by The Holy Spirit. We aim to operate out of this spirit in all we do, and judge entries by it.

Note this about the above entry. How is The Spirit of The Lord not God himself. Why would God's spirit and God be different persons if God is a spirit? This highlights how the teaching of the trinity really doesn't make sense. Would you call God an octet? It would technically be a more comprehensive picture.

Because of this we believe there is no meaningful difference between The Believer and God. The Father is The Spirit, The Spirit is in Christ and us, and we are one with Christ as Christ is one with The Father. So just as He is One with The Father, We are one with The Father. "I and my Father are One." Why is it blasphemy to mirror Christ?

This group maintains the belief that some "heretical" teachings are completely supported by The Bible, and we have no intention of rejecting The Truth Which is Christ.

A core principal of this group is the liberation from the mental strongholds of religion, to the realization of The Truth through Scripture. And overcoming the snare of language over understanding, which language cannot fully convey.

## 2 Corinthians 3:6
6 He has made us competent as ministers of a new covenant—not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.


# Formatting

If you open this file in Obsidian, everything folds nicely. Longer verses fold as well as the verse itself when following the shown markdown standard. Allowing for an easy visual of all supported verses.

Notice how every paragraph is separated by a new line, this helps with information overload by creating bite sized chunks. Ideally things should be as brief and simple as possible. Using ChatGPT to shorten your sentences is ok.

New maintainers are selected by the current group of maintainers as worthy based on maintainers discernment and prayer. If the group generally agrees and has all prayed about it, the new maintainer will be added.

There is no formal process. Only spirit led selection.

Make sure your entries follow the above template and are in the .md format, please do not add html to your entries. Markdown is fine, keep it minimal.

# Considerations

We recommend keeping a backup of this repo on an a flash drive or SSD in a safe place to preserve or distribute to a persecuted individual.

All donations made to this ministry will be split between every maintainer equally.

Please pray for this project, that it would remain pure and truthful, led by the spirit always. If we can have copies of this still around when Christ comes back it would be pretty awesome.
